# Colon Cancer Survival
## Predicting the probability of survival at two years after colon cancer diagnosis

The aim of this project was to predict the probability of survival at two years after colon cancer diagnosis by using a machine learning model.

### Instructions

Before executing the project, it is recommended to read the "Memory.pdf" file, which contains an introduction to the project, a description of the data used, the methodology, an overview of the main results and some conclusions of the project.

After reading the memory, please go to the "Notebooks" folder. You will find eight notebooks there, which must be executed in order. The notebooks 1 to 6 contain the data preparation and cleaning steps, as well as some plots. The notebook 7 contains the analysis and training of the machine learning model. Finally, the noteboook 8 contains the instructions to execute the visualisation.py file, which will redirect the user to an interactive visualisation of the project.

### Other information

In the "Data" folder you will find the files "sim_av_patient.zip", "sim_av_tumour.zip", "sim_sact_patient.zip", "sim_sact_tumour.zip" and "sim_sact_regimen.zip". These files contain the data that was used in the project. You will also find the files "Simulacrum-data-dictionary_TFM.xlsx", which is the dictionary of the database, "CPRD Cancer Registration Dictionary Set 17 up to 2016 v8.1" and "NHS codes.pdf", which are two sources that contain further information about the coding of some variables. There is also a folder called "lookup_tables.zip" which contains some SQL files with information about the coding of some variables. There is also a license of the data ("LICENSE.TXT") and a README.TXT file which describes the contents of the folder. 

The project was conducted using Jupyter Notebooks and Python (version 3.7.4) in a virtual environment that was accessed through Ubuntu (version 18.04.3). All the libraries that are necessary to execute the project are indicated at the beginning of each notebook.
